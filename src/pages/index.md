  body: Mental fitness is our capacity to handle life’s greatest challenges with a
    positive mindset rather than getting stressed or upset. When it comes to
    physical fitness, we are unlikely to be able to climb a mountain if we have
    not strengthened our muscles and built our stamina in advance. Mental
    fitness is similar; if we want to overcome stressful situations and view
    life through a positive mindset, we need to learn and practice the skills
    that will enable us to do so. In other words, we need to build our mental
    fitness.
