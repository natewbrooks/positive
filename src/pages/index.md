            Persistence is closely tied to having a long-term vision. It
            involves staying committed to goals that may take years to achieve,
            keeping the bigger picture in mind while managing day-to-day
            responsibilities.
          reason: Long-Term Vision

            The landscape of business is constantly changing. Persistence in the
            context of executive

            coaching means a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation.
            It's about

            persistently upgrading one's skills and knowledge base to stay
            relevant and effective.

            Persistence translates into maintaining high standards of

            In leadership, it's easy to become complacent, especially after

            emulate, creating a culture of perseverance and dedication within
            their organizations. In essence, persistence is a driving force in

            about actively striving for excellence, learning and adapting, and
            maintaining the discipline and motivation to achieve long-term
            success. This value deeply influences how we guide leaders in
