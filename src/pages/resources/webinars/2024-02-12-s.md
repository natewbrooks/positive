title: How To Master Recruiting
date: 2019-06-21T17:09:48.887Z
description: >-
  For a leader to succeed, they have to be able to hire the right people for
  their team. In fact nothing is more important. And while leaders are told to
  recruit the right people, they have never been taught how to recruit the right
  people. That is why most leaders spend 10% of their time recruiting, 90% of
  their time making up for recruiting mistakes.


  The result of this is huge inefficiencies, unhappy people and results below what is possible for leaders to achieve, not to mention very expensive and disruptive processes for the organisation when the wrong people are hired. 


  Billionaire John Caldwell once said, “If I’m lucky, I only get recruiting wrong 70% of the time”. But how is it that we accept being wrong so much of the time?


  In this video, Mads Faurholt shares based on science and research, as well as having hired and managed thousands of people; frameworks, processes, and tools for how you can become a world-class recruiter today, and immediately start hiring the right people, that will enable you and your organisation to reach its potential. 


  Mads Faurholt is a successful serial entrepreneur, bestselling author and keynote speaker, having founded and run companies across various sectors including technology, financial services, marketing, HR, food and education, with thousands of employees, and done several exits at valuations of up to over hundreds of million USD. Mads is a former Management Consultant at McKinsey & Company, and received his bachelor from Copenhagen Business School and his MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
