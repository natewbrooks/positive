In the hustle and bustle of life, finding the delicate balance between work, family, health,

and personal fulfillment can often feel like an insurmountable challenge. As a leadership

and performance coach, I frequently encounter individuals and teams grappling with the

quest to harmonize the demands of their professional and personal lives while still

leaving room for joy and well-being. If you're facing these challenges, rest assured,

you're not alone.





I've walked in those shoes, juggling endless hours at the office while striving to be a

devoted mother to six sons and a loving wife to my husband. I knew that long-term

happiness hinged on my ability to prioritize self-care through exercise, a healthy diet,

and sufficient sleep. Yet, the prospect of incorporating anything new into my routine

seemed overwhelming, if not downright impossible—until I stumbled upon James

Clear's transformative masterpiece,** Atomic Habits.**





This groundbreaking book revolutionized my thinking and approach to life. Among its

myriad lessons, two key takeaways— "habit stacking" and "just showing up"w— became

guiding principles that propelled me toward a healthier, more fulfilling life.



Habit stacking involves seamlessly integrating a new habit into an existing routine. For

me, it meant committing to a consistent exercise regimen. I initiated this change by

swapping my comfy slippers for sneakers after work. The rule was simple: the sneakers

stayed on until I completed at least a 20-minute workout, regardless of the pace. Fast

forward five years, and it's an ingrained part of my daily routine. I recently got a glowing

report card after a physical, and I’m able to wear my “thin clothes” again! A few years

ago I could not have imagined that such change is not only possible but sustainable.
