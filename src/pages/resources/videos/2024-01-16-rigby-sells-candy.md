  Growth mindset, the belief that we can improve, seems simple but is nuanced,
  powerful, and relevant to any person. In this session, Eduardo Briceño, who
  co-founded Mindset Works with Carol Dweck and has two TEDx talks watched by
  millions, deepens the understanding of growth mindset theory and practice. He
  shares key research, common misconceptions, and ways that we can all cultivate
  a growth mindset in ourselves and in others.
