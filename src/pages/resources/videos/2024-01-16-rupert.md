title: 'Playing Off the Page: Education and Leadership in the 21st Century'
date: 2021-09-27T19:13:18.000Z
description: >-
  What must leaders in education instill in those they mentor? As we step into
  an increasingly complex future, we need new models of teaching and discovery.
  Evan Mazunik talks about (and demonstrates) some of the most vital skills
  students need to survive and thrive in the 21st century. Evan Mazunik creates
  contemporary music as a composer, pianist, director, and educator in Denver,
  CO. Despite starting piano lessons as a near-sighted 4-year-old with stage
  fright, Evan has discovered the joy of music through improvisation. He
  conducts ensembles to play off the page using a sign language for real time
  composition.


  As a performer, he has played at creative music venues in NYC and Denver such
  as Dazzle, Roulette, and The Stone. As a composer, his commissions have
  included works for jazz band, choir, and various solo instruments, as well as
  interdisciplinary works for theater, dance, and film. As an educator, he has
  led master classes and workshops at the New School, MSU Denver, University of
  Indiana, the Royal Academy of Music in London, and many others, both as a
  soloist and in collaboration with other teaching artists. Evan received a
  Bachelors degree in piano performance and a Masters in jazz studies from the
  University of Iowa. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED
  conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more
